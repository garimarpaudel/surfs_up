## 1. Overview
#### W. Avy,an investor for Surf and Ice Cream Shop in Oahu, Hawaii wants to learn more about the weather before committing to build a shop. His main concern is the precipitation forcing the shop to close too frequently. He wants us to properly analyze data and run some analytics on a weather data set he has from the very island where we will open the shop. To analyze Hawaii's weather data, SQLAlchemy was used to query the SQLite database.

- The mean temperature of 75°F for June is higher than the mean temperature of 71°F for December.However, the opposite is true for precipitation. December had the higher precipitation of .22 inches while June had .14 inches.

- Both June and December showed similar min/max and average temperatures.Minimum and maximum temperatures for both June and december were not significantly different
- We can conclude that there is no drastic temperature fluctuation when we compare summer and winter months. 



## 3. Summary 
#### The investor's main concern was getting rained out too frequently. Comparing the June and December weather patterns, the temperatures and precipitation means are reasonably close. The temperature data is not strongly skewed for either month. The ratio of the temperatures to the precipitation for the two months is also reasonably similar with few outliers over 3 inches of precipitation. The data supports opening a Surf and Ice Cream shop year-round.
